    "Background": {
      "text": "<p>Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, and for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.</p>"

    "Economic overview": {
      "text": "<p>Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly service-based economy since joining the European Community - the EU's predecessor - in 1986. Over the following two decades, successive governments privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country joined the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU members.</p> <p> </p> <p>The economy grew by more than the EU average for much of the 1990s, but the rate of growth slowed in 2001-08. After the global financial crisis in 2008, Portugal’s economy contracted in 2009 and fell into recession from 2011 to 2013, as the government implemented spending cuts and tax increases to comply with conditions of an EU-IMF financial rescue package, signed in May 2011. Portugal successfully exited its EU-IMF program in May 2014, and its economic recovery gained traction in 2015 because of strong exports and a rebound in private consumption. GDP growth accelerated in 2016, and probably reached 2.5 % in 2017. Unemployment remained high, at 9.7% in 2017, but has improved steadily since peaking at 18% in 2013.</p> <p> </p> <p>The center-left minority Socialist government has unwound some unpopular austerity measures while managing to remain within most EU fiscal targets. The budget deficit fell from 11.2% of GDP in 2010 to 1.8% in 2017, the country’s lowest since democracy was restored in 1974, and surpassing the EU and IMF projections of 3%. Portugal exited the EU’s excessive deficit procedure in mid-2017.</p>"

        "text": "Portugal has a medium-sized telecom market with a strong mobile sector and a growing broadband customer base; before the pandemic, the country had seen improving economic growth, following several years of austerity measures; revenue among some operators remains under pressure, though investments in network upgrades are continuing in an effort to attract customers to high-end services; Portugal&rsquo;s broadband services have grown steadily in recent years, largely the result of joint efforts between the regulator and the key market operators which have invested in significant infrastructure upgrades; these operators are focused on fiber-based services, resulting in a migration of subscribers from DSL infrastructure; under the ownership of the Altice Group, Altice Portugal is focused on FttP, aiming to have covered 5.3 million premises by the end of 2020, and providing national coverage; the cable sector has also shifted towards fiber, with the principal cable company NOS investing in fiber rather than DOCSIS upgrades; in addition, Vodafone Portugal provides fiber to about two-thirds of premises; the growth in the fiber segment has resulted from shared infrastructure deals, including that between Vodafone and NOS; the government has also supported two open-access wholesale networks being built by dstelecom and Fibroglobal; the mobile market is dominated by the incumbent Altice Portugal, though it is seeing increasing competition from the other network operators, Vodafone Portugal, and NOS; the MVNO market remains largely undeveloped, partly because network operators have their own low-cost brands, in July 2020, for example, NOS launched its sub-brand WOO; collectively, MVNOs have about 2.9% share of the market; in October 2021 Dixarobil and Nowo secured spectrum in the final stage of a protracted 5G auction; population coverage by 3G infrastructure is universal, and most investment in the sector is being directed to LTE and 5G technologies; the MNOs have trialed 5G and are looking to launch commercial services.
